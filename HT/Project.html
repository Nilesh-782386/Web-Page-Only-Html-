        Microsoft Learn Student Club strongly believes in learning through applying hands-on knowledge.
        Thus, various problem statements and projects are assigned to team members regularly in order to help
        them develop their skills and build a practical approach towards theoretical knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have worked on several problem statements until now covering domains like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>IoT</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Image Processing</li>
        <li>And more...</li>
    </ul>
